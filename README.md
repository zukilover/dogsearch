# Technologies Used
## [Antd](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design)
The UI library saves time the application user interfaces as it provides a huge range of reusable components. It is highly performant and offers compatibility for a wide range of modern browsers.

## [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
I use Axios for data fetching because this tool provides a number of advantages compared to `fetch`, such as: automatic JSON data transformation, HTTP interceptors, and its built-in support for download progress.

## [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)
The css-in-js library uses optimized runtime CSS generation. Its flexible API is really useful for styling components, and it works great with Antd theming system.

## [React Query](https://github.com/tanstack/query)
With this library, we do not need to reinvent code pattern for fetching data from the server. It makes the code cleaner because we can separate view from data services and removes the need to put remote data inside the global state.

## [MSW](https://github.com/mswjs/msw)
This mocking library intercepts real network requests, it allows the tests to communicate with the real functionality of API requests.
